            <p>The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (lit. 'Chain of Central Schools') is a system of central government schools in India that are instituted under the aegis of the Ministry of Education (MHRD), Government of India. As of December 2020, it has a total of 1,245 schools in India, and three abroad. It is one of the world's largest chains of schools. The motto of Kendriya Vidyalayas is Tattvaṁ pūṣaṇa apāvr̥ṇu, lit. 'O Sun , please uncover that'; in other words, "where the face of truth is covered by the golden lid, O Sun (God), please uncover so that truth and dharma are visible.As of October 2020, there were 1,245 schools named Kendriya Vidyalayas. It is one of the largest school chains in world with 1240 schools in India and three operated abroad.[2] A total of 1,315,157 students (as of 6 December 2019) and 48,314 employees were on the rolls (as of 6 December 2019). [3]These were divided among 25 regions, each headed by a deputy commissioner.[4] The three Kendriya Vidyalayas outside India is in Kathmandu, Moscow, and Tehran. They are intended for children of Indian embassy staff and other expatriate employees of the government of India.he system came into being in 1963 under the name Central Schools. Later, the name was changed to Kendriya Vidyalaya. It is a non-profit organization. Its schools are all affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). Its objective is to educate children of the Indian Defence Services personnel who are often posted to remote locations. With the army starting its own Army Public Schools, the service was extended but not restricted to all central government employees.

                A uniform curriculum is followed by schools all over India. By providing a common syllabus and system of education, the Kendriya Vidyalayas are intended to ensure that the children of government employees do not face education disadvantages when their parents are transferred from one location to another.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">New Delhi: The school students participated in the celebrations of 72nd Republic Day today at Rajpath, New Delhi amid COVID-19 restrictions. Many of them displayed cultural performances and dances to showcase the traditions of their respective states. This time, a lesser number of students and audience was invited to attend the celebrations, hence various schools and Kendriya Vidyalayas organised their separate events to mark the day. Teachers and principals in various schools did the flag-hoisting ceremony while at some places the students were only allowed to attend the celebrations in a virtual mode.
                        President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with the Union Cabinet Ministers attended the Republic Day parade. The defence forces of the country marched across from Rashtrapati Bhawan to the India Gate. This time the government had invited the CBSE Classes 10,12 toppers and the University toppers to witness the parade from the PM’s box. The Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ was also present during the event.</p>
